Smart Resume Analyzer is an AI-powered tool designed to make the hiring process smarter by automatically analyzing resumes, matching skills to jobs, and offering helpful career suggestions using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).

Project Proposal
This proposal presents the development plan for Smart Resume Analyzer. This project uses Artificial Intelligence, specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML), to automate resume screening, skill analysis, and job matching. It explains the core problem we're addressing, our research goals, the methods we’ll be using, and also looks into ethical and industry-related aspects. Overall, it lays the groundwork for how the system will be designed and built as part of this academic project.

Features
🔍 Resume Parsing with NLP
Automatically reads and extracts relevant data (name, education, experience, skills) from resumes in PDF or DOCX format.

Uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to structure the data for analysis.

🧠 Skill Assessment
Analyzes the skills listed in the resume and compares them with job market requirements.

Highlights skill gaps and provides feedback on areas for improvement.

🤖 AI-Powered Job Matching
Matches a candidate's profile to the most relevant job roles using Machine Learning models.

Ranks job matches based on relevance and suitability score.

📊 Career Recommendation System
Suggests online courses, certifications, or training based on missing skills.

Helps users prepare better for future opportunities.

🛠️ Admin Panel
A secure login system for admins to upload job data, view parsed results, and manage candidate matches.

Provides basic analytics on system usage and job distribution.

🎨 User Dashboard
A clean and interactive dashboard (via Streamlit) where users can upload resumes and view their results.

Displays skill match percentage, recommended job roles, and suggestions for upskilling.

💬 YouTube Resource Integration
Suggests YouTube videos or tutorials for learning specific technical or soft skills.

Makes career development more accessible and actionable.
